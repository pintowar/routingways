This project was created for educational and experimental purposes.

This project has the objective to find some solutions for a variation of the classic TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem).

Actually I've implemented solutions with Brute Force, Simplex Algorithms using [Lp Solve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/), Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing using the [Encog](http://code.google.com/p/encog-java/) framework and Tabu Search using [Open TS](http://www.coin-or.org/Ots/index.html)

I also used [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) as build tool, so if you try to compile it from the code, you'll have to download it.

I've also have open sourced another educational project based on the [N-Puzzle](http://n-puzzle.googlecode.com) problem, so check it out if you got interest :)
